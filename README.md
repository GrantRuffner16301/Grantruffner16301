# Hi — I’m Grant Ruffner 👋

I’m a 52‑year‑old adult learner in Oil City, Pennsylvania, transitioning into software engineering. I’m currently enrolled in an AAS in AI Software Engineering at Maestro College and building a portfolio that demonstrates solid fundamentals, clean logic, and practical projects.

"Time not only to learn, let's build things as well."

## About me
- 🔭 Current study: AAS in AI Software Engineering — Maestro College
- 🎯 Career goal: Complete the AAS, build a strong project portfolio, continue to a BS in Computer Science, and move into a professional software or AI-adjacent role.
- 📍 Location: Oil City, Pennsylvania

## Cognitive & learning profile
- I learn quickly and from my mistakes; I recognize patterns and grasp abstract, complex concepts fast.
- Strong at reasoning, identifying multiple solution paths, and improving efficiency beyond defaults.
- Iterative problem-solver: experiment → identify errors → self-correct → learn the failure mode.

## Technical experience (self-taught + coursework)
Primary languages & platforms I’ve used:
- Python, Java, Kotlin, C++, Arduino
- Android Studio (basics) and general software development workflows

Most projects so far are in Python; some are Arduino and Android Studio projects from coursework and personal improvements.

## Problem-solving style
I work iteratively: experiment, identify errors, self-correct, and understand why something failed before fixing it. I value deep understanding and reasoning-based explanations over quick fixes.

## Learning philosophy
Perfect practice beats repetition. Practicing something incorrectly only reinforces bad habits — I prioritize correct fundamentals, clean logic, and solid foundations.

## Featured projects (auto-detected placeholders)
I will auto-detect and list top public repositories here. If you prefer specific projects, tell me their names or URLs and I will update this section.

### Project 1 - anolog clock app for windows

- Summary: short bullets

(Assets/screenshots will be added later. You can edit this README anytime.)

## Current focus
- Coursework projects for Maestro College and improving personal projects.
- Near term: add unit tests, GitHub Actions CI, and demo links/screenshots for each featured repo.

Quick repo README checklist (for each project)
- Title + one-line description
- Demo screenshot/GIF + short usage example
- Quick start: install + run (3–6 lines)
- Tests and CI badge (GitHub Actions)
- LICENSE (MIT recommended)
- Topics (set under repo Settings → Topics)

Tips
- Use small GIFs/screenshots in an assets/ folder to show results fast.
- Add a simple GitHub Actions workflow to run tests and show a badge.
- Never commit API keys or .env files; use GitHub Secrets.
